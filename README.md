# SERPENT Transient Solution

Ancillarily supported by and current primary development base for previous [SCALE Transient Solution](https://github.com/SodiumIodide/SCALE-Transient-Solution).

Used as supporting program for Master's Thesis: Analysis of Energy Released from Nuclear Excursions. The SERPENT 1.1.7 code system is called via the "sss" command in the form of a Python wrapper that utilizes the Ubuntu version of Linux on Windows feature by invoking the bash shell with a -c command modifier. It is important to note that no actual SERPENT source code is exhibited here, only the generic structure of an input file, containing no limited or classified information. This program is primarily a pre- and post-processor for the resulting input and output text files (in SERPENT's case, the output takes the form of MATLAB or Octave-compatible files). Processing is completed by the use of Newtonian mechanics, point reactor kinetics, and thermodynamic equations of state. For the equation of state, there is a reliance on the external [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org/) library.
