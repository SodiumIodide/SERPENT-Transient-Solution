# SERPENT Transient Solution

Used as supporting program for Master's Thesis. The SERPENT 1.1.7 code system is encased through the "sss" command in the form of a Python wrapper that utilizes the Ubuntu on Windows beta feature by invoking the bash shell with a -c command modifier. It is important to note that no actual SERPENT source code is exhibited here, only the generic structure of an input file, containing no limited or classified information. This program is primarily a pre- and post-processor for the resulting input and output text files (in SERPENT's case, the output takes the form of MATLAB or Octave-compatible files).
